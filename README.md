# Practicality of Using Variable Transformations in Multiple Linear Regression

In this project, I compared a full additive multiple linear regression model (MLR) with an inverse transformation dependent response variable (and interaction terms for better fit) to one without an inverse transformation dependent response variable. In our previous research, [Gender Wage Inequality in STEM](https://github.com/lgibson7/Gender-Wage-Inequality-in-STEM), my colleagues and I used MLR to explore the relationship between gender demographics and median salary of STEM major categories. Our final model used the inverse transformation of the response variable to improve the model fit. While transforming response and/or explanatory variables can lead to a better fitting model, often it is not easily understood by the average person. In this project, I set out to find how prediction power is lost by not using a transformed response variable to fit a MLR model.
